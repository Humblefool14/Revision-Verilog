/**********************************************************************
 *
 * Function:    memTestDevice()
 *
 * Description: Test the integrity of a physical memory device by
 *              performing an increment/decrement test over the
 *              entire region.  In the process every storage bit
 *              in the device is tested as a zero and a one.  The
 *              base address and the size of the region are
 *              selected by the caller.
 *
 * Notes:       
 *
 * Returns:     NULL if the test succeeds.  Also, in that case, the
 *              entire memory region will be filled with zeros.
 *
 *              A non-zero result is the first address at which an
 *              incorrect value was read back.  By examining the
 *              contents of memory, it may be possible to gather
 *              additional information about the problem.
